## Version history

### iOS

#### Version 1.2

* Implemented user guides on several screens.

#### Version 1.1.1

* Fix some errors on localized texts arising from the previous update.

#### Version 1.1

* New features:
	- Added functionality to add or subtract a value to the result of a "sum dice values" roll (between 0 and 15).
	- Added functionality to define successes and criticals with comparisons of the type "greater or equal than", "equal to" and "lower or equal than" a dice value. Compatible with D20 games such as Infinity®.

* Bugfixes
	- Fixed computation of successes and criticals: now criticals are a particular case of successes, rather than an independent result.
	- Fixed some translations typos.
	- Fixed an issue causing the History Log to be sorted incorrectly.

#### Version 1.0

Initial app release.

* Features included:
	- Dice roller feature to perform a single roll with multiple dices.
	- Result feature to compute different outcomes from the roll, including summing results, concatenating and counting successes/failures with thresholds.
	- Feature to add post-roll steps to the roll, such as adding/discarding dices, rerolls or replacements.
	- Persistance for rolls, either to consult them or to perform a new roll with the same parameters.
	- Settings allow to define a default roll that will prefill the roll parameters. They may always be changed before rolling.

### Android

#### Version 1.2.1

* Fixed an issue causing the stepper to increase or decrease success and critical values not appearing for "Successes / failures" rolls.

#### Version 1.2

* Implemented swipe to delete steps in post-roll sequence.
* Implemented reordering of steps in post-roll sequence.
